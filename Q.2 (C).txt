Here are the key differences between class methods and static methods:

Class Methods:
A class method is a method that is bound to the class itself rather than to instances of the class.
It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.
The first parameter of a class method is traditionally named cls, which refers to the class itself.
Class methods can access and modify class-level variables.
They are often used to create factory methods or to access or modify class-level attributes.
Class methods can be called on either the class itself or on instances of the class.

Example:
python
class MyClass:
    class_var = 10  # Class-level variable

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print("Class method called")
        print("Class variable:", cls.class_var)

MyClass.class_method()  # Calling the class method on the class
Static Methods:
A static method is a method that is bound to the class itself and does not have access to the class or instance state.
It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.
Static methods do not require a reference to either the class (cls) or an instance (self) as the first parameter.
They are similar to regular functions but are included in the class for organizational purposes.
Static methods are often used for utility functions that are related to the class but do not require access to instance or class variables.
They can be called on either the class itself or on instances of the class, but they do not have access to instance or class variables.

Example:
python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static method called")

MyClass.static_method()  # Calling the static method on the class
